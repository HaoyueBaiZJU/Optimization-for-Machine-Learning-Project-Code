# Homework 1
We consider ridge regression problem with randomly generated data. The goal is to implement gradient descent and experiment with different strong-convexity settings and different learning rates. Test with different weights of regularizer.

Implement functions: 

1) smoothness parameter

2) closed form solution of the ridge regression problem

3) compute the objective function value

4) compute the gradient of the objective function

5) gradient descent algorithm for t iterations
